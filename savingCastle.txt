Instinctually, you pull the shield up just in the knick of time and you are able to deflect
The knights initial blow. In an instant, you take out the dagger and drive it forward!

It's a hit! Instead of the metal 'tink' you expected you feel the knife hit the flesh.
The knight screams in agony and bats you away with his shield.

You fall to the ground in a daze. Your vision falters and everything goes black.
After a few seconds you come to and are able to pull yourself back to your feet. 
As you regain your sense of where you are you remember the knight! 

Quickly, you look back to see him go limp and completely fall off the horse.
As you go over to investigate, you inspect the gentleman and realize you drove the dagger
Straight into his femoral artery. 8th grade biology taught you no person, regardless of their
Size and strength can survive a direct hit to the body's largest artery. 

The knight looks to you and says, "Alas, I have been slain. By the law of the land all this,
My title, my armor, and my horse are yours. Take care of it all better than I...."
