“Miraculously you land on your feet. As you stand tall you take a deep breath and enjoy the peaceful serene scenery. 
Not far out in the distance you see a stone structure with a wicker windmill. 
The horizon is a beautiful mountain landscape, akin to a Bob Ross painting. 
Maybe this actually is a happy accident. 

But don’t settle in too quickly. 
Your instincts take over and you hear hoof beats behind you, getting louder, closer. 
You turn around just in time to see a Knight charging at you, full steam.”
