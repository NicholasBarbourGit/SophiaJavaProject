“You instantly knock your head against something. By the sound of it, the loud thud mixed with a tiny TINK.
You assume it was something metal. Great. If waking up  in a strange room and then being sucked into a magic door portal
wasn’t enough, let’s add a concussion to the mix. Your head is ringing and your eyes are moving in and out of focus. 
Someone bumps you from behind in an attempt to push you out of the way and they hurry on ahead. 

Quickly, you realize that the ringing and flashing may not by solely from blunt force trauma to the head. 
Once your eyes regroup and start working together again you notice red and yellow flashing lights and a PA system overhead. 
‘Hurry to your closest emergency escape pod. The ship is under attack. Hurry to your closest emergency escape pod. 
The ship is under attack.’”
