“You find yourself waking up in a strange room. Your back is itchy and your neck is sore. 
You look around to discover that your “bed” is nothing more than what appears to be a cheap bed sheet lain over straw. 
Your “pillow” is nothing more than bunches of leaves hastily thrown into a sad excuse for a pile. 

The room is lit only by an open skylight that can’t be any longer or wider than a standard broom handle. 
It must be midday. Every time you look out to try and gather more of an idea of where you are, the sun blinds you. 
You reflexively look down and wait for your vision to come back. 

As you look back up to take in the scenery, your heart sinks. You’re in a four walled room. 
Each wall seems to be the same height, width and length, making the room as close to a perfect square as you’ve ever seen. 

Three of the walls are made of grey stone. It’s dark and that’s about all you can make out for now. 
The fourth wall is also made of the same grey stone but remains unique. 
The last wall offers two doors with large wrought iron rings  for handles.”
